    # - none: deny all access for this verb/entity (hide pages + block APIs)
    # - all: ignore scope (read everything)
    # - own: only owned records (metrics-core doesn't have ownership fields, so this denies access)
    # - ldd: owner OR matching L/D/D (metrics-core doesn't have LDD fields, so this denies access)

    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
    # Note: Metrics-core entities don't have ownership or LDD fields, so `own` and `ldd` modes deny access (only `all` mode allows access).
